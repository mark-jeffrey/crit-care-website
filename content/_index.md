I thought expertise was supposed to make the right decisions come more easily. After over a decade as a doctor in Intensive Care, I can't help feel the opposite is true - ignorance was bliss. Writing a blog does not come naturally to me, but I increasingly recognise the value of committing thoughts to the page. Creating it is also an excuse to learn how the internet works, which seems important. However, this is hardly a blog and more a collection of resources that have helped me. Maybe that will change with time.
