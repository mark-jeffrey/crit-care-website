## Predicting difficult airway and intubation complications

The baseline risk for difficult airway (8-11%) and severe complications (38%) is high in all critically ill patients. Difficult airway greatly increases the risk of severe complcations during intubation (30-35% vs 50-60%). Scoring systems for elective surgery therefore seriously underestimate risk in this cohort. 

Consider the [MACOCHA Score](https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201210-1851OC) to identify patients at paritcularly high risk and plan accordingly.

It is worth noting that Mallampati score does the heavy lifting in prediction difficult intubations (Identified 51/82 alone, compared to 62/82 with the full score). 

## Score

| Factor | Score |
| --- | --- | 
| *Patient factors* |  |
| Mallampati III or IV | 5 |
| Obstructive Sleep Apnoea | 2 | 
| Restricted neck movement | 1 | 
| Mouth opening <3cm | 1 |
| *Pathology factors* | |
| Coma | 1 |
| Severe hypoxaemia <80% | 1 |
| *Operator factors* | |
| Non-anaesthetist | 1 |

## Interpretation

Incidence of difficult airway or airway complication by score:

| Score | Risk | 
| --- | --- |
| 1-2 | 2% |
| 3-4 | 5% | 
| 4-5 | 25% |
| 6-7 | 45% |
| 8-9 | 50% | 
| 10-12 | 100% |
