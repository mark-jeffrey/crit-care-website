# Critical Care Intubation Checklist

Adapted from Difficult Airway Society [Guidelines for the management of tracheal intubation in critically ill adults](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2017.10.021)

## Prepare the patient

### Assess and position

- Reliable IV/IO access
- Optimise position
	- Sit-up
	- Mattress hard
- Airway assessment
	- Identify cricothyroid membrane
	- Awake intubation option?
- Allergies?

### Preoxygenation

- 3 mins or ETCO<sub>2</sub> >85%
- Consider CPAP/NIV
- Apnoeic Nasal O<sub>2</sub>

### Optimise patient state

- Fluid/vasopressor/inotrope
- Aspirate NG tube
- Delayed sequence intubation

## Prepare the equipment

### Apply monitors

- SpO<sub>2</sub>
- waveform capnography
- ECG
- Blood pressure

### Check equipment

- Tracheal tubes x2 (cuffs checked)
- Direct laryngoscopes x2
- Videolaryngoscope
- Bougie/stylet
- Working suction
- Supraglottic airways
- Oropharyngeal/nasal airways
- Flexible scope/Aintree
- FONA set

### Check drugs

- Consider ketamine
- Relaxant
- Pressor/inotrope
- Maintenance sedation

## Prepare the team

- Allocate roles (one person may have more than one role)
	- Team leader
	- 1<sup>st</sup> Intubator
	- 2<sup>nd</sup> Intubator
	- Cricoid force
	- Intubators assistant
	- Drugs
	- Monitoring patient
	- Runner
	- MILS (if indicated)
	- FONA
- Who do we call for help?
- Who is noting the time?

## Prepare for difficulty

- Can we wake the patient if intubation fails?
- Verbalise "the airway plan is..."
	- **Plan A**
		- Drugs & laryngoscopy
	- **Plan B/C**
		- Supraglottic airway 
		- Face-mask
		- Fibreoptic intubation via supragottic airway
	- **Plan D**
- Does anyone have any questions or concerns?
